# TTM-challenge-CVPR-23

This is the code base we used for [Ego4d TTM challenge](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1625/overview) held at CVPR'23. We secured the second place in the contest.

## Approach

You can locate a technical report within this repository. Our approach relies on Transformer-based models. To enhance the performance, we have employed an ensemble of two trained models. We might explore further improvements to our approach in the future, so we only provide two JSON result files at this moment along with the ensemble script.

## Reference

We suggest preprocessing the data following:
